# Accident-Prediction
Accident prediction for a global food delivery app using forecasting

Disclaimer: All the information presented in the following text is anonomysed and created synthetically. The same applies to the “Dummy data” file.

Business Problem
The CEO of Yemeksepeti, in Turkey, is worried about accidents involving riders, during their
working time, since it can negatively affect the company (e.g. reputational risk, loss of business,
etc.). The CEO asked the Risk Management team to create a model to predict the number of
accidents involving riders.
You are a risk specialist working at Delivery Hero SE. and you were assigned with this
task. Please prepare yourself to present your model to the CEO.

Additional Info:
● By “rider” we mean an individual delivery the food from the restaurants to the customer
house;
● You will receive a data set of three years (we have already done the data extraction for
you) Disclaimer: “Dummy data” file does not contain real data. It was developed for
recruitment purposes only;
● Please ignore the covid-19 situation in your model;
● If needed use external data to complete your case study and explain the options taken
(to build the model and to select information as source).
Requirements/our expectations:
1. Dashboard development
a. Explain the ETL process;
b. Define the Business Objective (max. 3), Business Requirement (Data) and
Business Result (KPI) and rate the importance of each business objective (use
provided template);
c. Use the given internal data, add further internal dummy data if needed and
incorporate external data (external data) to predict the number of accidents (see
task);
d. Visualize your KPIs.
2. Supervised machine learning (ML)
a. Think of an adequate machine learning algorithm, we could use to predict future
accidents. Please describe in detail the process of implementing an ML
algorithm;

b. Do you think the presented data is sufficient or not? Please explain why, or why
not and perhaps propose additional input variables;
c. Please code an algorithm and use the existing data to train your model;
d. Please visualize your prediction and provide an explanation;
